# AI-Now-Data-Analysis-Classwork
This repository contains various datasets and practice files used to master different types of Excel formulas and functions, including Text, Conditional, Date/Time, and Aggregate functions.
# AI Now Data Analysis & Business Intelligence Repository

This repository serves as a centralized collection of classwork files, raw data, and resources used for analysis and Business Intelligence (BI) visualization in the **AI Now** training program.

The project encompasses data cleaning and calculation using Excel, and the creation of interactive dashboards using Power BI.



##  Repository Contents (Source Data)

The files in this repository are saved in CSV format, extracted from different sheets and sessions of the core classwork workbook.

| File Name | Associated Session/Case | Key Formulas/Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `AI Now ClassWork.2xlsx.xlsx - Session_04.csv` | **Session 04** | Text Formulas (`PROPER`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, etc.) and data parsing. |
| `AI Now ClassWork.2xlsx.xlsx - Sheet2.csv` | **General Exercise** | Sales data for basic calculations, ranking, and performance metrics. |
| `AI Now ClassWork.xlsx - Case 1.csv` | **Case 1 (Session 02)** | Student grade data using **Aggregate Functions** (`SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MIN`, `MAX`). |
| `AI NOW ClassWork 4(AutoRecovered).xlsx - Session_05.csv` | **Session 05** | **Conditional Formulas** (`IF`, `SWITCH`) for data classification (e.g., Performance Categories, Business Size). |
| `AI Now function 5.xlsx - Session_06.csv` | **Session 06** | **Date and Time Functions** (`YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DATEDIF`) for calculating employee tenure and future dates. |


##  Business Intelligence & Visualization (Future Plan)

This data is intended to be used as a source for creating interactive dashboards.

### Next Steps

* **Platform:** Microsoft Power BI
* **Goal:** To transform the raw data and Excel logic into visual reports that offer actionable insights.
* **Action:** Once the Power BI dashboard is created, the final `.pbix` file will be uploaded here, and this section will be updated with a project summary and a screenshot of the completed dashboard.





##  Prerequisites

To replicate the original analysis or interact with the final output:

1.  **Microsoft Excel** (or equivalent) to review the source data and original formula logic.
2.  **Microsoft Power BI Desktop** (free to download) to open and interact with any completed Power BI dashboard files (`.pbix`) you upload later.
